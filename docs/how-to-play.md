# How to Play

The Neon Desert is a blockchain based game, requiring real crypto and a smart dApp browser

If this is all brand new, don't be too intimidated!
With this guide and a few bucks you'll be off in no time...

## I'm kinda new to this... dApp? smart browser? what even is an NFT...

dApps, or decentralized app, are programs that run on the blockchain
they look like regular websites but they allow you to interact with smart contracts, the code that power blockchain applications
To connect you need a special browser, like The Neon Desert

A smart browser will include a crypto wallet, allowing you to send and receive tokens such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ingame Neon
It also includes a web-browser capable of sending these cryptocurrency tokens to smart contract, to execute code on the blockchain

If you're new to this we really recommend you only start with a few dollars, which is more than enough to dive right into The Neon Desert!

## Apps

Everything from here on out will require a dApp browser

We recommend Metamask on mobile
For desktop we recommend Brave Browser with the Metamask extension

Follow their in-app instructions for setup

## How to Connect

The Neon Desert is on the Harmony network
You need to connect your Metamask to Harmony in order to interact with dApps on that network

### Live RPC

## How to get Neon

NEON is the base currency of the game and is used for all common actions
For now, you can only buy it once you're already on the Harmony network
So first you'll need to buy an other token (ONE, the base token on Harmony) from an exchange
then send it to your Metamask wallet, then swap your ONE for NEON

If you're new to crypto and blockchain games we really recommend you start small
$10 USD should be plenty to get the full experience of The Neon Desert

1. Buy ONE, the base token on Harmony
   go to kucoin.com, setup an account, fund it with credit card or other crypto, and trade for ONE tokens

2. Send ONE to your Metamask
   make sure you're on harmony, copy metamask address, paste in kucoin withdrawal form, make sure you select harmony network

3. Swap ONE for NEON
   link to sushiswap with the pair already set, select how much ONE to swap for NEON

## Connect to the game

Lastly, you need to tell Metamask that The Neon Desert is allowed to request transactions
Don't worry, you still will review and approve every transaction where you actually send crypto
click connect in game, see how it doesn't cost anything or say anything weird, click approve on the tx popup

## Your first blockchain transaction

Let's create a Character first, as they're needed for most actions in The Neon Desert

1. Click on the Avatars page and select Create
1. Select a name for your Character
1. accept tx
1. watch progress

## next steps and things to keep in mind

fees
remember, each time you perform a transactions (tx) on the blockchain you pay a tx fee
on Harmony these are very small but can add up over time
additionally, some ingame action are more expensive than others
always make sure to check transaction cost and if things are much higher than normal don't accept the tx

security
how safe and secure is your seed phrase
