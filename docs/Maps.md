# Maps

Maps are tiered items in The Neon Desert. (Tlvl 1, Tlvl 2, etc.)

They represent the locations of various regions in The Neon Desert.

A Tlvl 1 location (a Cedar forest, for example) may be located by deciphering a Tlvl 1 Map. A Tlvl 2 location (an Oak forest, for example) may be located by deciphering a Tlvl 2 Map. So on and so forth.

An undeciphered Tlvl 3 Map is guaranteed, once deciphered, to give you access to a Tlvl 3 area. Undeciphered, you will be unaware of what type of location it is. It may be a dungeon, or a mine, or a rare encampment. The only way to discover the Mapâ€™s location is to decipher it.

Maps may also be created. If you have the requisite Cartography Skill and the requisite materials (paper, ink, pens) you may create a map to any area you wish. These maps may then be sold on the Marketplace.
