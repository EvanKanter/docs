# Avatars

_Bind a new entity to do your bidding, your Avatar will walk The Neon Desert as an extension of your will. Build a massive army of specialized teams as you expand across the chains_

## Overview

Avatars are the main way to interact with The Neon Desert. They are sent on expeditions and to encounters, gaining skills and resources on their way. As Avatars perform activities such as [Mining](skills/mining.md) and [Combat] they gain levels in that skill. The stronger your Avatars the more resources you gain and more zones you can access!

## Cost

New blank Avatars cost 1 NEON to create and contain lvl 1 in all skills and have no bonuses. New Avatars can implant [Souls](souls.md) gained during [Recompile](recompile.md) to carry down bonuses and abilities.
