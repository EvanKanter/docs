# Governance

## Game Ownership

Creator will never retain any ownership type qualities for entire game and ecosystem

Creator will never create any backdoors allowing them to withdraw funds, invalidate or otherwise modify assets owned by others

Creator will never have the ability to revoke assets, or send on behalf of an other wallet

All assets earned bought or created in-game are owned by the ERC-20 or ERC-721 token holder, and no one else especially including game creators can ever change or modify anyone's assets but their own
