# Ethos

The Mother and the Programmer vow to instill the Ethos in All of The Neon Desert

- DAO governance, aiming towards 100% eventual control
- Zero contracts will allow for developer or admin abuse
- Everything open source and trust-less
- Publish contract addresses and empower users to write their own code
- Gameplay first, not profit
