# Recompile

** 15% designed and built **

> Recompile your Avatar to harness their wisdom

Ready to increase your skillcaps and receive awesome bonuses? Time to recompile!
_warning_ Recompile burns up your existing character, it can never be retreived _warning_

In exchange for burning your character, its soul will be condensed into an NFT for you to implant in a new character (sell on the open market). You'll be able level back up their skills much faster since your base stats will be much stronger

## Bonuses

The primary soul bonuses available on Recompile are specific to the skill you are focusing on

- % speed increase
- % production increase
- % exp increase
- skill cap increase (requires skill to be at current cap)

## Cost

The base cost to recompile is 1 NEON and will increase the skill cap of ALL skills at their current max

You can pay an additional 1 NEON per skill to raise its stats in production and experience gain

## Misc

On recompiling, that 1 NEON that would have been recycled is destroyed, burnt in the process of reading your soul
The NEON cost is also burned

## Math

Skillcaps increment by 10 points each recompile and must be at their current cap to increase

Production and speed increase by 10% of the skill that's being recompiled

Experience gain increases by 1% of the skill in question
