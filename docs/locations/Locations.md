# Locations

There are many locations in The Neon Desert for your Avatars to travel

## Harmony

**Wilderness**

_The Mother created her Wilderness oasis in Harmony_

The Wilderness is the first location accessible and where Avatars can begin their journey. In The Wilderness Avatars can forage for [crafting](../crafting.md) materials include stones, sticks, plant fibers, and apples.

**Altar**

_Call upon The Mother for her blessings_

Pray at the Altar to receive NEON. Eventually, the Altar will contain incenstive pools for staking ingame tokens.

**Wishing Well**

_Throw your hard earned resources into the void_
