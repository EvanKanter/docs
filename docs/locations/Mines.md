## Overview

Mines are Locations in the Neon Desert which offer some of the most valuable resources you will ever find: Various ores, gems, and coal.

Mines can be found throughout The Neon Desert in large mountains or caves and vary greatly in variety. Mines are where players may engage in Mining, allowing them to Mine for Ores, Gems, and Coal.

## Mechanics

Mines are broken into Area Levels which correspond to a playerâ€™s Mining Tier Level. See the table below. For information regarding Mining, visit the [Mining Page](../skills/Mining.md).

| Forest Name 	| Required Mining Skill 	| Resource Yield 	|
|-------------	|----------------------------	|----------------	|
| Copper Mine 	| 0.0 - 49.9                 	| Copper Ore     	|
| Tin mine    	| 50.0 - 99.9                	| Tine Ore       	|
| Iron Mine   	| 100.0 - 149.9              	| Iron Ore       	|
| Coal Mine   	| 150.0 - 199.9              	| Coal           	|

As you can see from the table above, Ore is broken into Tiers which corresponds to the Area from which it was obtained. The higher an Ore's Tier, the greater the bonuses to things like durability, swing speed, or resource yeild for any items crafted from that Ore.
