## Overview

Forests are Locations in the Neon Desert which offer in equal measure valuable resources and perilous dangers.

Trees grow throughout The Neon Desert in large forests and vary greatly in variety. Forests are where players may engage in woodcutting, allowing them to chop down trees to obtain wood.

## Mechanics

Forests are broken into Area Levels which correspond to a player’s Woodcutting Tier Level. See the table below. For information regarding Woodcutting, visit the [Woodcutting Page](../skills/Woodcutting.md).

| Forest Name    	| Required Woodcutting Skill 	| Resource Yield 	|
|----------------	|----------------------------	|----------------	|
| Cedar Forest   	| 0.0 - 49.9                 	| Cedar Logs     	|
| Pine Forest    	| 50.0 - 99.9                	| Pine Logs      	|
| Oak Forest     	| 100.0 - 149.9              	| Oak Logs       	|
| Hickory Forest 	| 150.0 - 199.9              	| Hickory Logs   	|

As you can see from the table above, Wood is broken into Tiers which corresponds to the Area from which it was obtained. The higher a Wood’s Tier, the greater the bonuses to things like durability or swing speed for any items crafted from that Wood.
