# Crafting

Say you want to create an Axe
You select Axe
  then select what wood to use
  then select what metal to use

So you select axe
  first craft a handle
    which wood? oak has more durability, cedar has more speed
  and a head
    supply the stone/metal
so how you select how to craft the Item, effects how awesome it is

So maybe you find a special forest of mystical wood on your planet
When used in an axe or pickaxe you get +100% resource gathering

###
Items
Handle and axehead
Rune crafting or jewel crafting to enhance

This is just a test.
