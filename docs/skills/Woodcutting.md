# Woodcutting

Woodcutting is a resource gathering skill, and one of the first that you’ll use in The Neon Desert.

Woodcutting requires the equipping of items (Axes) and, like all Skills in The Neon Desert, operates at a rate of 1 Action per minute, or 60 Actions per hour.

Woodcutting is the skill you will use to acquire Logs, which come in a variety of Tiers.

To begin woodcutting, you’ll start with a Beginner Axe made of Foraged materials (Sticks, Stones, and Lashings from Plant Fibers).

Items degrade in The Neon Desert, so you’ll need to forage for many Sticks, Stones, and Plant Fibers to create multiple beginner Axes.

The Woodcutting skill is Tiered to give you access to multiple Tiers of Forests, each yeileding their corresponding Tier of Logs.

The first Forest in which you may cut wood is the Cedar Forest (a Tlvl 1 Forest). From Woodcutting Slvls 0-49.9 you’ll have access to the Cedar Forest. Woodcutting in the Cedar Forest will produce Cedar Logs.

Upon reaching Woodcutting Slvl 50, you’ll have access to the Tlvl 2 Forest, the Maple Forest which yields Tlvl 2 Logs, Maple Logs.

Logs may be used to create Axe Handles may be created from Logs. The Tlvl of Log used to create an Axe handle with determine it’s bonuses (increased item yield / increased durability).
