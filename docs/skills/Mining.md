# Mining for Ore


Mining is a resource gathering skill, and one of the first that you’ll use in The Neon Desert.

Mining requires the equipping of items (Pickaxes) and, like all Skills in The Neon Desert, operates at a rate of 1 Action per minute, or 60 Actions per hour.

Mining is the skill you will use to acquire Ore, which come in a variety of Tiers.

To begin Mining, you’ll start with a Beginner Pickaxe made of Foraged materials (Sticks, Stones, and Lashings from Plant Fibers).

Items degrade in The Neon Desert, so you’ll need to forage for many Sticks, Stones, and Plant Fibers to create multiple Beginner Pickaxes.

The Mining skill is Tiered to give you access to multiple Tiers of Mines, each yielding their corresponding Tier of Ores.

The first Mine in which you may Mine is the Copper Mine (a Tlvl 1 Mine). From Mining Slvls 0-49.9 you’ll have access to the Copper Mine. Mining in the Copper Mine will produce Copper Ore.

Upon reaching Mining Slvl 50, you’ll have access to the Tlvl 2 Mine, the Gold Mine which yields Tlvl 2 Ore, Gold Ore.

Via the Metallurgy skill, Ore may be used to create Ingots. The Tlvl of Ore used to create an Ingot will determine/result in the corresponding Tlvl of Ingot.
