## Overview

Mining is a resource gathering skill which yields Metal in the form of Ore. Mining requires the equipping of Pickxes and is performed in Locations called Mines.

Metal is a valuable Resource and is used for many items, both utilities and weaponry.
***
## Mechanics

Like all resource gathering Skills in The Neon Desert, Mining operates on the Skill Action System (SAS) and functions in a corresponding Location, Mines.

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, therefore during 1 hour of Mining you will make 60 attempts to gather Ore.
***
## Skill, Tier, Area, and Resource Levels

Your Mining Skill Level (SLvl) is broken into Tiers (TLvl) which correspond to Area Level (ALvl) and Resource Level (RLvl). Your Mining SLvl determines your Mining TLvl, which in turn determines the ALvl which you may access and therefore the RLvl which you may gather.

| Skill Level (SLvl) 	| Tier Level (TLvl) 	| Area Level (ALvl) 	| Resource Level (RLvl) 	|
|--------------------	|-------------------	|-------------------	|-----------------------	|
| 0.0 - 49.9         	| 1                 	| 1 (Copper Mine)  	| 1 (Copper Ore)        	|
| 50.0 - 99.9        	| 2                 	| 2                 	| 2                     	|
| 100.0 - 149.9      	| 3                 	| 3                 	| 3                     	|
| 150.0 - 199.9      	| 4                 	| 4                 	| 4                     	|

## Beginning Mining

In order to begin Mining, you will need to equip yourself with a Pickaxe. The only Pickaxes available to you at the start of your journey are Stone Pickaxes which must be Crafted via Foraged materials.

Items lose durability in The Neon Desert, so it is advisable to either craft multiple Stone Pickaxes, or to possess surplus foraged materials in order to repair your Stone Pickaxe regularly.
***
## Resource Generation

Mining will yield Metal in the form of Ore of an RLvl which corresponds to the ALvl in which you are Mining.

The lowest ALvl Mine (ALvl 1) is the Copper Mine which will yield the lowest RLvl (RLvl 1) Ore which is Copper Ore.

As mentioned above in the Mechanics section, a single Mining Skill Action will take exactly 1 minute, and therefore during 1 hour of Mining you will make 60 attempts to gather Logs.

Not all attempts will be successful. Your success in Mining depends on three variables: Your Mining Skill Level (SLvl), your Mining Tier Level (TLvl), and the Area Level (ALvl) in which you are Mining.

Within a Mining TLvl, each complete Skill Point (1.0 Skill) provides a 2% chance to receive the corresponding RLvl Ore, capped at a maximum of a 100% chance durring each Skill Action.

## Resource Generation Examples

### Skill, Area, and Resource Level Example

| Mining SLvl 	| TLvl 	| ALvl 	| Chance to receive corresponding RLvl Ore durring each Skill Action 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| 27.6 	| 1 	| 1 (Copper Mine) 	| 54% chance for RLvl 1 Ore (Copper Ore) 	|
| 53.7 	| 2 	| 1 (Copper Mine) 	| 100% chance for RLvl 1 Ore (Copper Ore) 	|
| 53.7 	| 2 	| 2 (ALvl 2 Mine) 	| 6% chance for RLvl 2 Ore (RLvl 2 Ore) 	|
| 114.2 	| 3 	| 3 (ALvl 2 Mine) 	| 28% chance for RLvl 3 Ore (RLvl 3 Ore) 	|

### Skill and Resource Level Example - Comparative

| Mining SLvl 	| RLvl 1 chance 	| RLvl 2 chance 	| RLvl 3 chance 	| RLvl 4 chance 	|
|------------------	|---------------	|---------------	|---------------	|---------------	|
| 27.6             	| 54%           	| 0%            	| 0%            	| 0%            	|
| 53.7             	| 100%          	| 6%            	| 0%            	| 0%            	|
| 114.2            	| 100%          	| 100%          	| 28%           	| 0%            	|
| 179.0            	| 100%          	| 100%          	| 100%          	| 58%           	|

## Tier Level and Skill Gain Penalty
:::caution Important!
It is crucial to note that once you have reached a Tier Level, your ability to gain Skill Points by Mining in the ALvl corresponding to the previous TLvl will be heavily penalized and eventually reach zero.
:::

For every 1 complete Skill Point (1.0 Skill) you are into a new TLvl, you will lose 10% of your Skill Gain per Skill Action from the ALvl corresponding to the previous Tier.

See the example below in which between the SLvls 50.0 - 60.0 Mining (TLvl 2 Mining), the penalty for Mining in an ALvl 1 Area is applied.

| Mining SLvl 	| Mining TLvl 	| While Mining in ALvl 1, the percentage of Skill you will gain 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 50.0 	| 2 	| 100% 	|
| 51.0 	| 2 	| 90% 	|
| 52.0 	| 2 	| 80% 	|
| 53.0 	| 2 	| 70% 	|
| 54.0 	| 2 	| 60% 	|
| 55.0 	| 2 	| 50% 	|
| 56.0 	| 2 	| 40% 	|
| 57.0 	| 2 	| 30% 	|
| 58.0 	| 2 	| 20% 	|
| 59.0 	| 2 	| 10% 	|
| 60.0 	| 2 	| 0% 	|

As you can see from the table above, beyond SLvl 60.0 Mining, you will no longer gain Skill Points by Mining in an ALvl 1 Mine.

## Pickaxes

Pickaxes are the tools with which you may perform Pickaxes. Pickaxes can be made of various materials and consist of two distinct parts: An Axe Handle, and a Pickaxe Head.

Pickaxe Heads are made from Metal Ingots, which themselves are made of Ore.

Ore and Ingots are both Resources. Ore possesses an RLvl corresponding to the ALvl from which they were gathered, and Ingots possess and RLvl corresponding to the Ore from which they were smelted.

All crafted Items in The Neon Desert possess an Item Level (ILvl) corresponding the RLvl from which they were crafted.

Crafted Tools and Weapons possess any bonuses conferred by the ILvl and Item Category of their component parts.

Metal items, like Pickaxe Heads, for example, gain bonuses to Durability based on their superior quality and durability. These bonuses are Tiered and correspond to the ILvl from which they were made.

As An example, an Axe made with a Copper Pickaxe Head (which is ILvl 1 because Copper Ore is RLvl 1, and Copper Ingots are therefore RLvl 1) will obtain a Metal ILvl 1 bonus of 10% Durability.

You can read more about Item Recipes and their final bonuses based on their component parts in the Items section.

Suffice it to say that it is advisable to craft any tools you are using out of the highest ILvl materials you have. A Pickaxe made from a Cedar Axe Handle and a Copper Pickxe Head (Cedar Copper Pickaxe) will have 10% bonuses to both Swing Speed and Durability.
