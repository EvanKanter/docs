# A Skills based game

The Neon Desert is a skills based game. You are not locked into Races or Classes. Each character may be customized with whichever skills you wish, offering maximum customization.

Each character has an initial skill cap of 700 skill points. Each individual skill has an initial soft skill cap of 100 which may be raised by meeting certain criteria via the Recompile system.

Skills are action-based. Each skill operates at a rate of 1 action per minute, or 60 actions per hour.

Skills are gained in increments of 0.1 skill points. Skills are gained at a rate of 10 actions per 0.1 skill point gained. At a rate of 1 action per minute (60 actions per hour), you will gain 0.6 skill points per hour.

At this rate, you will gain 14.4 skill per day, and it will take you 6.94 days to reach Slvl 100 in a particular skill.

At this rate, it would take you just under 50 days to max a character’s skill (7 skills at Slvl 100).

As you will see, this is only the beginning of your character’s journey. Individual skill caps may be increased via the Recompile system.
