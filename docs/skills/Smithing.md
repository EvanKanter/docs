## Mechanics

For information about specific Skill Mechanics, visit the [Skill Page](Skills.md)

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, therefore during 1 hour of Smithing you will make 60 attempts to either Smelt Ore into Ingots or Craft items.
***

Your Smithing Skill Level is broken into Tiers which correspond to Resource Level and Item Level. Your Smithing Skill Level determines your Smithing Tier Level, which in turn determines the Resource Level with which you may Refine or Craft and therefore the Item Level Level which you may Craft.

| Skill Level 	| Tier Level 	| Resource Level 	| Item Level Level 	|
|--------------------	|-------------------	|-------------------	|-----------------------	|
| 0.0 - 49.9         	| 1                 	| 1 (Copper Ore)  	| 1 (Copper Ingots)        	|

## Beginning Smithing

In order to begin Smithing, you will need to equip yourself with a Smith Hammer. The only Smith Hammers available to you at the start of your journey are Stone Smith Hammers which must be Crafted via [Foraged](Foraging.md) materials.

Items lose durability in The Neon Desert, so it is advisable to either craft multiple Stone Smith Hammers, or to possess surplus Foraged materials in order to repair your Stone Smith Hammers regularly.
