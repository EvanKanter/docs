## Overview

Melee is a combat skill which will enable you to engage with your enemies at close range. The Melee primary stat is Strength (Str).

***

## Mechanics

For information about specific skill mechanics, visit the [Skill Page](Skills.md)

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, and therefore during 1 hour of combat you will make 60 attempts to execute a melee attack.

Combat Skill Action rates may be modified.

## Skill, Tier, and Area Levels

Your Melee skill is broken into Tiers which correspond to the Area Level of an [Area](../locations/Locations.md) in which you may engage in combat.


| Skill Level 	| Tier Level 	| Area Level of an Area in which you may engage in Combat 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 0.0 - 49.9 	| 1 	| 1 	|
| 50.0 - 99.9 	| 2 	| 2 	|
| 100.0 - 149.9 	| 3 	| 3 	|
| 150.0 - 199.9 	| 4 	| 4 	|
