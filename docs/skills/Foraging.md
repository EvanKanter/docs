## Locations

Foraging will ultimately become available in many locations throughout The Neon Desert. To begin your journey you will Forage in the beginnger area known as The Wilderness.

### The Wilderness

The wilderness is a beginner location, offering minimal threats and a uniquely high quantity of available resources. This means that unlike many other locations in The Neon Desert, while Foraging in The Wilderness each Action of Foraging (each attempt to gather resources) will be successful.

In 1 hour of Foraging in The Wilderness you will acquire 60 items.

During each succesfull Action of Foraging in The Wilderness you have a 25% chance to find either Sticks, Stones, Plant Fibers, or Apples. You will only find 1 item during each successful action of Foraging.

## Threats

Threat encounters in The Neon Desert are unlike Combat in that they do not operate based on your Combat Skills, rather they are based on your equipped weapons and peripherals.

You will encounter many dangers in The Neon Desert, not the least of which are wild and fearless animals and creatures in various locatoins. Unlike Combat Areas, encountered threats while Foraging are unique in that they don't normally pose a risk of death.

They do however represent a very real threat of losing significant portions of the items in your inventory (the items you've already foraged), but they also offer you a chance to acquire rarer and more valuable items.

### Wolves

Wolves are rarely encountered in The Neon Desert, and when they are, they are most commonly found in The Wilderness.

Fearsome and stlealthy, if you are not equiped with a weapon of some sort, any Wolf will pose a serious threat and you'll be forced to run, causing you to lose a significant portion of the Foraged items already in your inventory.

If, however, you do have a weapon equiped (a Stone Dagger for example) You may easily slay the Wolf and obtain it's valuable Pelt.
