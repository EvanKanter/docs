# The first activity in The Neon Desert

Foraging is an activity which is not skill based, but still allows you to procure your first items in The Neon Desert.

Foraging operates on the same Action system as every other skill (1 action per minute). Therefore in 1 hour of foraging you will make 60 attempts to gather resources. Each attempt will result in the gathering of a single item. Therefore, the maximum number of items you may forage in a single hour is 60.

The first location in which you may forage is called The Wilderness. This is a beginner area with minimal threats.

The possible items which may be foraged in The Wilderness are Sticks, Stones, Plant Fibers, and Apples.

Also, there is a percentage change in every forage attempt that you may encounter a Wolf, whereupon if you defeat it you will receive a Wolf Pelt.

There is a 25% chance to receive a specific item (Stick, Stone, Plant Fiber, or Apple) during each foraging attempt. Therefore, after 1 hour (60 foraging attempts), you may receive 15 Sticks, 15 Stones, 15 Plant Fibers, and 15 Apples, as an example. Your item distribution will of course vary probabilistically 

During each foraging attempt there is a 1% chance that you will encounter a wolf. A wolf is an animal encounter during which if you are equipped with the requisite weapon (Stone Dagger) you are guaranteed to defeat it and obtain a Wolf Pelt. Upon defeating the wolf, your Stone Dagger will be destroyed. Each Stone Dagger is destroyed upon defeating a wolfe.

If you do not have a Stone Dagger equipped, you will fail to defeat the wolf and a random percentage of your foraged materials obtained during this Foraging expedition will be lost.

A Stone Dagger is an item which may be crafted for at the Crafting Station with 1 Stone. Therefore, it is advisable that after you forage your first few stones you immediately return to the crafting station to craft a few Stone Daggers. Make sure to return to the crafting table periodically to replenish your stock of Stone Daggers.
