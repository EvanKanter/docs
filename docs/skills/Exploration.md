## Overview

Exploration is the skill you will use to find new Locations in The Neon Desert like [Forests](../locations/Forests.md) and [Mines](../locations/Mines.md), [Encampments](../locations/Encampments.md) and [Dungeons](../locations/Dungeons.md), and many other areas in which to gather resources or conquer and plunder.

When you begin your journey, outside of the [Wilderness](../locations/Wilderness.md) (which contains the Crafting Table) you’ll have access only to the Cedar Forest, the Copper Mine, and the Goblin Encampment.

All three of these Locations have an Area Level (ALvl) of 1.

Ultimately when a new Avatar enters The Neon Desert they will have access only to one Location of Each ALvl.

In order to find more Locations, you will have to find them via Exploration or purchase Maps in the Marketplace.
***
## Mechanics

Like all skills in The Neon Desert, Exploration operates on the Skill Action System (SAS).

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, therefore during 1 hour of Exploration you will make 60 attempts to find a new Location.
***
## Skill, Tier, and Area Levels

Your Exploration skill is broken into Tiers. Your Exploration Skill Level (SLvl)  determines your Exploration Tier Level (TLvl), which in turn determines the Area Level (ALvl) you may discover while Exploring.

| Skill Level (SLvl) 	| Tier Level (TLvl) 	| Area Level (ALvl) of Locations you may discover 	|
|--------------------	|-------------------	|-------------------------------------------------	|
| 0.0 - 49.9         	| 1                 	| 1                                               	|
| 50.0 - 99.9        	| 2                 	| 2                                               	|
| 100.0 - 149.9      	| 3                 	| 3                                               	|
| 150.0 - 199.9      	| 4                 	| 4                                               	|

## Beginning Exploration

In order to begin Exploring, no equipment is required to use the Skill.
***
## Location Discovery Chance

As mentioned above in the Mechanics section, a single Exploration Skill Action will take exactly 1 minute, and therefore during 1 hour of Exploration you will make 60 attempts to discover a new Location.

Not all attempts will be successful. Your success in Woodcutting depends on three variables: Your Exploration Skill Level (SLvl), your Exploration Tier Level (TLvl), and the Area Level (ALvl) which you are able to discover.

Within each Exploration TLvl, every 5 complete Skill Points (5.0 Skill) provides a 1% chance to discover a Location with an ALvl corresponding to that TLvl within a 24 hour period, maxing out at a 10% chance to discover a Location with an ALvl corresponding to that TLvl over a 24 hour period.

## Location Discovery Chance Examples

### Skill, Tier, and Area Level Example

| Exploration SLvl 	| Exploration TLvl 	| Chance to find ALvl 1 Location within a 24 Hour Period 	|
|------------------	|------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------	|
| 15.2             	| 1                	| 3%                                                     	|
| 22.7             	| 1                	| 4%                                                     	|
| 43.2             	| 1                	| 8%                                                     	|
| 50.0             	| 2                	| 10%                                                    	|

### Skill, Tier, and Area Level Example - Comparative

| Exploration SLvl 	| Exploration TLvl 	| ALvl 1 Location discovery chance over 24 hours 	| ALvl 2 Location discovery chance over 24 hours 	| ALvl 3 Location discovery chance over 24 hours 	| ALvl 4 Location discovery chance over 24 hours 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| 15.2 	| 1 	| 3% 	| 0% 	| 0% 	| 0% 	|
| 58.9 	| 2 	| 10% 	| 1% 	| 0% 	| 0% 	|
| 114.7 	| 1 	| 10% 	| 10% 	| 2% 	| 0% 	|
| 192.2 	| 2 	| 10% 	| 10% 	| 10% 	| 8% 	|

As you can see, the maximum percentage chance that you will have to discover a Location of a particular ALvl is 10% over a 24 hour period. At Exploration Skill Level 200, you will have a 10% chance to discover each individual ALvl (ALvls 1-4) which means that you will have a 40% chance to discover at least 1 location over that 24 hour period.
