## Overview

Woodworking is a Crafting Skill which allows you to create items out of Wood. Woodcutting requires the equipping of various Woodworker's tools, including Planes and Saws, however the first Woodworking tool available to you will be a Chisel. Woodworking also requires a Location at which to Craft items, like the [Crafting Table](Crafting.md).

Woodcutting is a valuable Skill and will allow you to craft not only Weapons and Armor, but a number of Utility Items as well.

## Mechanics

For information about specific Skill Mechanics, visit the [Skill Page](Skills.md)

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, therefore during 1 hour of Woodcutting you will make 60 attempts to either Refine Logs into Planks or Craft items.
***

Your Woodcutting Skill Level is broken into Tiers which correspond to Resource Level and Item Level. Your Woodcutting Skill Level determines your Woodcutting Tier Level, which in turn determines the Resource Level with which you may Refine or Craft and therefore the Item Level Level which you may Craft.

| Skill Level 	| Tier Level 	| Resource Level 	| Item Level Level 	|
|--------------------	|-------------------	|-------------------	|-----------------------	|

## Beginning Woodcutting

In order to begin Woodcutting, you will need to equip yourself with a Chisel. The only Chisels available to you at the start of your journey are Stone Stone Chisels which must be Crafted via [Foraged](Foraging.md) materials.

Items lose durability in The Neon Desert, so it is advisable to either craft multiple Stone Chisels, or to possess surplus Foraged materials in order to repair your Stone Stone Chisels regularly.
