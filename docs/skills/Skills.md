## Overview

TND is a ‘skills based’ game. Your skills are how you interact with the world. As you develop your skills they will empower you to gather more valuable resources, to craft powerful items like weapons and armor, to discover greater locations like Wild Forests and Wild Mines, Encampments and Dungeons, and to defeat your enemies and plunder their treasure.

### Humble Beginnings

Upon entering TND you will begin by Foraging in the wilderness for basic supplies. From these foraged resources you will create the basic tools with which to begin your journey.

### Growing Your Skills

Your first and immediately actionable skills will be Woodcutting and Mining. Using your basic tools, in the Cedar Forest and Copper Mine you will harvest the resources necessary to Craft new and more durable tools with which to gather even more valuable resources as you develop your skills.

### Combat and Adventuring

When you are ready, you will adventure into the Goblin Encampment where you will develop your Combat skills and claim any treasure you may find as reward for your courage. Weild a Sword and Shiled to raise Swordsmanship and Parrying, or heft a Two-Handed Mace to raise your Macing, or equip a Bow and Arrows to raise your Archery.

## Mechanics

Skills are action-based. Each skill operates at a rate of 1 action per minute, or 60 actions per hour. Skills are gained in increments of 0.1 skill points, at a rate of 10 actions per 0.1 skill point gained. At a rate of 1 action per minute (60 actions per hour), you will gain 0.6 skill points per hour.

## Skill Caps

### Individual Skill Caps

Each individual skill starts with an initial cap of 100 skill points, which may eventually be raised via the Recompile system.

Skills may only be raised to their current individual cap. Though skills are usable once they have reached their cap, a character will not gain further skill points in any maxed skill until its cap has been raised.

### Maximum Skill Points

Each character has a soft cap on maximum total skill points of 700. It is important to note however that any skill points above 100 in an individual skill DO NOT count towards the soft cap of 700 skill points.

### Example 1: Skill Caps Unreached
:::note Skill Caps Unreached

In the following example, the character has focused on 7 skills and has not yet raised the cap of any individual skill nor hit the cap on maximum skill points.

:::

| Skill                        | Skill Level | Skill Cap |
|------------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Woodcutting                  | 92.6        | 100       |
| Mining                       | 57.8        | 100       |
| Exploration                  | 90.1        | 100       |
| Cartography                  | 86.0        | 100       |
| Archery                      | 42.7        | 100       |
| Bowcraft                     | 54.8        | 100       |
| Stealth                      | 84.3        | 100       |
| **Total Skill Points / Cap** | **508.3**   | **700**   |

### Example 2: Maximum Skill Point Cap Unreached / Individual Skill Cap Raised

:::note Maximum Skill Point Cap Unreached / Individual Skill Cap Raised

In the following example, the character has focused on 7 skills and has raised the cap of Woodcutting. Please note that the 2.6 skill points over 100 in the Woodcutting skill **DO NOT** count toward the maximum total skill point cap of 700.

:::

| Skill                        | Skill Level | Skill Cap |
|------------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Woodcutting                  | **102.6**   | **_110_** |
| Mining                       | 57.8        | 100       |
| Exploration                  | 90.1        | 100       |
| Cartography                  | 86.0        | 100       |
| Archery                      | 42.7        | 100       |
| Bowcraft                     | 54.8        | 100       |
| Stealth                      | 84.3        | 100       |
| **Total Skill Points / Cap** | **515.7**   | **700**   |

### Example 3: Maximum Skill Point Cap Reached

:::note Maximum Skill Point Cap Reached

In the following example, the character has focused on 9 skills and has raised the cap of Woodcutting. Please note that the 2.6 skill points over 100 in the Woodcutting skill **DO NOT** count toward the maximum total skill point cap of 700. Because the maximum total skill point cap of 700 has been reached, *the character may gain no further skill points in any skill aside from Woodcutting* who's skill points over 100 DO NOT count toward the maximum total skill point cap of 700.

| Skill                        | Skill Level | Skill Cap |
|------------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Woodcutting                  | **102.6**   | **_110_** |
| Mining                       | 57.8        | 100       |

| Healing                      | 100.0       | 100       |
| Tracking                     | 84.3        | 100       |
| **Total Skill Points / Cap** | **702.6**   | **700**   |

## Skill Gain Rates

As mentioned in the Mechanics section above, skills are action-based. Each skill operates at a rate of 1 action per minute, or 60 actions per hour. Skills are gained in increments of 0.1 skill points, at a rate of 10 actions per 0.1 skill point gained. At a rate of 1 action per minute (60 actions per hour), you will gain 0.6 skill points per hour.

Further, at this rate, you will gain 14.4 skill per day, and it will take you 6.94 days to reach level 100 in a particular skill

### Example 1: Time To Reach Skill Level (Recompile Unfactored)

:::caution Recompile Unfactored!!!

Note that the following time table **DOES NOT** factor in Recompiles, wich you may [read more about here](./Recompile.md). This table illustrates the requisite skilling time to reach a particular skill level starting from 0.0 skill points.
