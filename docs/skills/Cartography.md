# The study of maps

Cartography is the skill which will allow players to decipher maps discovered in The Neon Desert, and also to create maps of their own.

Maps are tokens/nfts which allow a player to locate certain destinations in The Neon Desert. Found Maps must be deciphered, and doing so requires the Cartography skill.

Maps may be found in Treasure Chests. Treasure Chests will be located in dungeons.

Maps may also be created. If you have the requisite materials and the requisite cartography skill, maps may be created to mark the location of any area you wish.

If you find a rare forest or mine, or a rare dungeon or encampment, you may create a map detailing its location and then sell the map on the Marketplace, allowing other players to access said location.

Cartography skill may be gained by deciphering maps. Your chance to decipher a map is based on your cartography skill level. An attempt at deciphering a map takes 1 action (1 minute). Failed attempts will result in skill gain, but the map will remain undeciphered.

Like all skills and their items, Maps and the Cartography skill are tiered. Cartography Slvl 0-49.9 will allow you to decipher and create Tlvl 1 Maps with varying degrees of success. Cartography Slvl 50-99.9 will allow Tlvl 2 Maps, so on and so forth.

There is no penalty for failing to decipher a Map. Even failed attempts will result in skill gain. There are, however, penalties for failing to draw a Map. Some of the requisite materials will be burned upon a failed attempt to draw a Map. Therefore, unless you have an abundance of Map making materials (paper, ink, pens), it is recommended that you focus on finding and deciphering maps from treasure chests to raise your Cartography skill level.

Each tier of item (Map) is represented by a 50 point distribution (Slvl 0-49.9). Each full skill point (1.0 skill) will add an additional 1% chance to decipher or create a map. Therefore, the maximum chance you will have to decipher or create a map will be 50%. You can see how this will take time, and it is in your best interest to raise your skill by deciphering maps rather than creating them, as failed attempts at Map creation will cost resources.
