## Overview

Cartography is the skill which will allow players to decipher maps discovered in The Neon Desert, and also to create maps of their own. Maps created by players may be sold on the Marketplace.
***
## Mechanics

For information about specific Skill Mechanics, visit the [Skill Page](Skills.md)

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, and therefore during 1 hour you will make either 60 attempts to decipher a Map (or Maps) or 60 attempts to draw a Map (or Maps).
***
## Skill, Tier, and Area Levels

Your Cartography Skill Level is broken into Tiers which correspond to the Area Level of a Map which you may decipher or to the Area Level of a Location to which you may draw a Map.

| Skill Level 	| Tier Level 	| Area Level of a Map you may decipher or of a Location to which you may draw a Map 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 0.0 - 49.9 	| 1 	| 1 	|
| 50.0 - 99.9 	| 2 	| 2 	|
| 100.0 - 149.9 	| 3 	| 3 	|
| 150.0 - 199.9 	| 4 	| 4 	|

## Beginning Cartography

There are two ways to use and gain Skill Points in Cartography: deciphering Maps and creating Maps.

In order to begin using Cartography, you will need either undeciphered Maps (found throughout The Neon Desert - for example as loot in the Loot Chest after defeating a Goblin Encampment), or Paper, Feather Pen, and Ink in order to begin drawing your own Maps.
***
## Deciphering Maps

The Cartography Skill will allow you to decipher any Maps you may find throughout The Neon Desert. Maps may be found as Loot in various places.

Like all Skills in The Neon Desert, Cartography operates on the Skill Action System (SAS).

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, and therefore during 1 hour you will make 60 attempts to decipher a Map.

Not all attempts will be successful. Your success in deciphering a Map via Cartography depends on three variables: your Cartography Skill Level, your Cartography Tier Level, and the Area Level of the Map you are attempting to decipher.

Within a Cartography Tier, each complete Skill Point (1.0 Skill) provides a 0.03% chance to decipher a Map of the corresponding Area Level during each Skill Action, capping at 1.5%.

As you can see, with 1.5% chance to decipher a given Map per skill action, at 1 Skill action per minute (60 Skill Actions per hour), you will have a 90% chance to decipher that Map over 1 hour.

### Deciphering Maps - Skill, Tier, and Area Level Example

| Skill Level 	| Tier Level 	| Chance to Decipher Area Level 1 Map over 1 hour 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 13.4 	| 1 	| 23.4% 	|
| 20.0 	| 1 	| 36% 	|
| 39.9 	| 1 	| 70.2% 	|
| 50.0 	| 1 	| 90% 	|

| Skill Level 	| Tier Level 	| Chance to decipher Area Level 1 Map over 1 hour 	| Chance to decipher Area Level 2 Map over 1 hour 	| Chance to decipher Area Level 3 Map over 1 hour 	| Chance to decipher Area Level 4 Map over 1 hour 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| 39.9 	| 1 	| 70.2% 	| 0% 	| 0% 	| 0% 	|
| 62.0 	| 2 	| 90% 	| 21.6% 	| 0% 	| 0% 	|
| 142.7 	| 3 	| 90% 	| 90% 	| 75.6% 	| 0% 	|
| 151.1 	| 4 	| 90% 	| 90% 	| 90% 	| 1.8% 	|

## Deciphering Maps - Tier Level and Skill Gain Penalty

:::caution Important!
It is crucial to note that once you have reached a Tier Level, your ability to gain Skill Points by Deciphering Maps in the Area Level corresponding to the previous Tier will be heavily penalized and eventually reach zero.
:::

For every 1 complete Skill Point (1.0 Skill) you are into a new Tier, you will lose 10% of your Skill Gain per Skill Action from the Area Level corresponding to the previous Tier.

See the example below in which between the Skill Levels 50.0 - 60.0 Cartography (Tier Level 2 Cartography), the penalty for Deciphering Maps of an Area Level 1 is applied.

| Skill Level 	| Tier Level 	| While Deciphering Area Level 1 Maps, the percentage of Skill you will gain 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 50.0 	| 2 	| 100% 	|
| 51.0 	| 2 	| 90% 	|
| 52.0 	| 2 	| 80% 	|
| 53.0 	| 2 	| 70% 	|
| 54.0 	| 2 	| 60% 	|
| 55.0 	| 2 	| 50% 	|
| 56.0 	| 2 	| 40% 	|
| 57.0 	| 2 	| 30% 	|
| 58.0 	| 2 	| 20% 	|
| 59.0 	| 2 	| 10% 	|
| 60.0 	| 2 	| 0% 	|

As you can see from the table above, beyond Skill Level 60.0 Cartography, you will no longer gain Skill Points by Deciphering Area Level 1 Maps.

## Drawing Maps

The Cartography Skill allows you to create a Map or Maps to any Location you have found via Exploration throughout The Neon Desert. Maps provide access to Locations that a player has not yet personally discovered via Exploration and may be sold on the Marketplace.

### Requisite Materials

The drawing of Maps requires the following materials: Paper, Ink, and a Feather Pen.

| Requisite Items 	| Item Source 	|
|---	|---	|
| Paper 	| Paper is made from crushed Plant Fibers which may be found while Foraging in the Wilderness. 	|
| Ink 	| Ink is made from Sap which may be found while Woodcutting in a Forest. 	|
| Feather Pen 	| A Feather Pen is made from Feathers, an early source of which (provided you are equipped with a Leather Sling) is an Eagle Encounter while Woodcutting in the Forest. 	|

Like all Skills in The Neon Desert, Cartography operates on the Skill Action System (SAS).

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, and therefore during 1 hour you will make 60 attempts to draw a Map.

Not all attempts will be successful. Your success in drawing a Map via Cartography depends on three variables: your Skill Level, your Tier Level, and the Area Level of the Location to which you are trying to draw a Map.

Within a Cartography Tier, each complete Skill Point (1.0 Skill) provides a 0.03% chance to draw a Map of the corresponding Area Level during each Skill Action, capping at 1.5%.

As you can see, with 1.5% chance to draw a Map per skill action, at 1 Skill action per minute (60 Skill Actions per hour), you will have a 90% chance to draw that Map over 1 hour.
