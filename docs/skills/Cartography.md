## Overview

Cartography is the skill which will allow players to decipher maps discovered in The Neon Desert, and also to create maps of their own. Maps created by players may be sold on the Marketplace.

## Mechanics

Like all Skills in The Neon Desert, Cartography operates on the Skill Action System (SAS).

A Skill Action takes 1 minute, and therefore during 1 hour you will make either 60 attempts to decipher a Map (or Maps) or 60 attempts to draw a Map (or Maps).

## Skill, Tier, and Area Levels

Your Cartography Skill Level (SLvl) is broken into Tiers (TLvl) which correspond to the ALvl of a Map which you may decipher or to the ALvl of a Location to which you may draw a Map.

| Skill Level (SLvl) 	| Tier Level (TLvl) 	| Area Level of a Map you may decipher or of a Location to which you may draw a Map 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 0.0 - 49.9 	| 1 	| 1 	|
| 50.0 - 99.9 	| 2 	| 2 	|
| 100.0 - 149.9 	| 3 	| 3 	|
| 150.0 - 199.9 	| 4 	| 4 	|

## Beginning Cartography

There are two ways to use and gain Skill Points in Cartography: deciphering Maps and creating Maps.

In order to begin using Cartography, you will need either undeciphered Maps (found throughout The Neon Desert - for example as loot in the Loot Chest after defeating a Goblin Encampment), or Paper, Feather Pen, and Ink in order to begin drawing your own Maps.

### Deciphering Maps

The Cartography Skill will allow you to decipher any Maps you may find throughout The Neon Desert. Maps may be found as Loot in various places.
