# Worlds

The Mother created the Wilderness, her oasis in Harmony, the first World in The Neon Desert. In the Wilderness you can gather the most basic of materials including Stones and Sticks.

When you're ready to gather more advanced resources and craft better items, your Avatars will need to venture to other Worlds.

Created by a powerful Alchemy, pocket Worlds are formed in The Neon Desert each with their own locations to discover and exploit.

Find advanced resources and unique locations

- forests with cedar and maple wood
- mines with copper and gold ore
- goblin camps
- npc and lore events

## World Tiers and Cost

Tier 1 Worlds will be first to launch and contain at least one of Cedar Forest or a Copper Mine, a dungeon, and a small chance for a Gold deposit.

The cost to mint a Tier 1 World is `World_Count * 10 NEON`, so the 1st World costs 10 neon, the 20th costs 200, and the 100th costs 1000 Neon.

Future tiers of Worlds will follow and contain additional resources and special locations

## Attributes

Worlds have locations

Forests and Mines come in size small, medium, large, and huge

## Resource Collection

Each location can only accomodate a certain amount of Avatars at a time, and can exhaust its resources - some temporarily some permenantly.

Common resources like wood and ore get can only produce a certain quantity over time and need time to replenish
If you use too much too fast exploiting your resources, they will regenerate slower

## Land borrow/rent

Own a world with valuable resources?
Exploit the new wealth yourself, or lease out access to your land for a fee.

List your land for access leases on the market to allow other players temporary access to a resource

Allow owner to keep X uses for themselves so it doesn't get oversold
Or a progressive tax system

### Examples

Joe mints a new Tier1 World. It's the 27th World created so it costs Joe 270 NEON . Joe finds a Cedar Forest and is lucky to find a Gold deposit. He lends out all spots to his Cedar Forest for 1 NEON per day per Avatar, but decides to level up his own miner to fully exploit the Gold deposit and sell his Gold on the open market.
